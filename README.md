## Short description

Help people to connect people

### What's the problem?

This pandemic has affected each and everyone in the world in one form or the another. 
Many countries have declared restrictive measures such as lockdown, shelter in place or stay at home orders to contain the pandemic.
So in such condition helping and supporting each other, understanding others requirements and acting on it is a necessity.


### The idea

To overcome the above challenges and extend a lending hand or take actions we have come up with a unique solution to help and connect people during this pandemic and can be used any other similar situations. 
Solving shortage of essentials resources to the common man:
- Create Platform for user to Give & Take 
- Help the help seeker around you. 
- Share your extra resources that you have  
- Karma will act as NEXUS between the Help Seekers And The Change Makers!

## Long description

[More detail is available here](DESCRIPTION.md)

## Project roadmap/Business Model: 

Users on the platform will be awarded with Karma points based on their activity on the app. These Karma points can be later redeemed on any of the services like airline booking, online purchases, taxi rides etc. Karma points can also be used to measure or rate the social behaviour of a customer applying for a Home loan, a student applying for a university program and organisation pitching for funding for an idea. 

Organisation can also share their employeesâ€™ ratings on our platform and the employees and use any of our programs to generate a coupon and avail any of the services across travel, shopping etc 

### Funding and sustainability:
The app is build using the IBM credits available for participating in the CFC, we would require funding to continue to use these services and third-party services. We also plan to develop the features we have mentioned in the future roadmap some of these features require IBM services like IBM NLP and IBM Watson services and we are looking for funding to develop the same. 

### Future technology Road Map: 
IBM Natural Language processing (for sentiment analysis of the help created and rating the urgency and criticality of the help) 
IBM Watson for enabling chatbot to answer frequently asked questions about a current situation and get contact information of government agencies and NGO's
