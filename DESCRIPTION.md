# Karma

_Karma_ is a platform for the users to give and to take, it’s an application for connecting people to request help and to give help. 

As we move through these tested times, accessing personal help through applications  has undergone a significant change, we decided to reinvent some of the ways by which, on minimal clicks our app can bring value to both the person asking for help and also to people who are giving help 

This app can serve as a valid unique solution for faster sourcing of finding help as well as connecting communities nearby in turn helping out each other, especially in the new reality of pandemic restrictions. It gives users an easy way to create their help that is needed and connect with people nearby willing to help. With rich features like Karma points, it also encourages people to give help to whomever they can. 

Help can be requested on behalf of others if someone don’t have a smartphone. 

NGO’s can be onboarded or can use the app to find and help needy people.
